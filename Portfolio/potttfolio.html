            <p>A flight booking website is a virtual platform that allows users to search for, compare, and book airline tickets for various destinations. These websites have revolutionized the way people plan and book their travel by offering a convenient and efficient way to explore flight options, check prices, and make reservations from the comfort of their own homes or mobile devices. Typically, users can input their travel details such as departure and arrival locations, travel dates, and the number of passengers to access a wide range of flight options. Flight booking websites often provide valuable information, including flight schedules, airlines, seat availability, and pricing details. Many also offer additional features such as seat selection, travel insurance options, and the ability to bundle flights with accommodations or car rentals. With the convenience and flexibility these websites provide, travelers can easily plan their trips, find the best deals, and secure their seats, making the process of booking flights more accessible and user-friendly..</p>

            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>Parking lot vacancy detection using YOLO-NAS (You Only Look Once - Neural Architecture Search) is an advanced computer vision system that efficiently identifies and counts available parking spaces in real-time. Utilizing YOLO, a powerful object detection algorithm, it continuously analyzes camera feeds to detect empty parking spaces and updates the count as vehicles enter and exit the lot. This technology offers real-time data on parking space availability, enabling drivers to quickly locate open spots and enhancing overall parking lot management. YOLO-NAS combines precision and efficiency, making it a valuable solution for optimizing parking operations and improving the user experience.</p>
